## About
[**Judge0 IDE**](https://ide.judge0.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.

Judge0 IDE is using [**Judge0**](https://ce.judge0.com) for executing the user's source code.

Visit https://ide.judge0.com, and enjoy happy coding. :)

üîó **This project is based on the original [Judge0 IDE repository](https://github.com/judge0/ide).**
